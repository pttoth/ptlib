build:
	when building from terminal, cmake doesn't find the freshly built 'ptlib.a' to link with the test program
	calling make twice finishes the build correctly
	need some research...

generic:
    - various camelcase problems

event:
    - event can be triggered from outside the owning class (operator() is public)
    - doesn't handle multiple registrations of the same function
		may not be an issue
    - event doesn't have a 'clear()' function
    - event.add() should be named event.addListener()/addCallback()
        same for remove()

Config:
    - error prints should use "CONFIG: " in front of every message
        maybe even print config file path
        it should use logger::debug as message output
    - outputs wrong error message when trying to write read-only config file
    - need to check other behaviors regarding read / write access to files
    - invalid query exceptions don't contain info about the key and value pair
        fix: added _buildErrorStringInvalidValue(int eKey) prototype, need testing
logging:
    - cannot handle unicode paths yet
        need c++17 and 'std::filesystem' for that
          but 'std::filesystem' is buggy with MinGW 8.1.0
          and there is no newer official prebuilt version
        c++14 + 'experimental/filesystem' is also inadequate
    - not multiprocess yet
    - can't create folders on windows yet
utility:
    SplitString
        check whether it fails if there is no occurence of separator sequence
