add logger class
    switch all output writing references to logger

make Config recognize /r/n line endings correctly on linux
	currently it reads them as "content\r"

finish config refactor

pt::array
	make utility Vector handling functions for Array too
	make it standard-iterable

	see HPLEngine's approach
		they aliased their array type with an std::vector

	check whether event 'AddCallback()' versions are unnecessary
		with the 'T&&' version introduced
		'T&&' exclusive features:
			- functor objects
			- type[=] lambdas (check others)

verify Config::readS()
    says it throws 'std::invalid_exception'
